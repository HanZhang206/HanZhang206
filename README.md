### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/).

In 2022, I earned a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering with Honors from [University of California, Davis](https://bme.ucdavis.edu/), and MS in Biomedical Engineering from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/). In my free time, you can find me hiking and playing badminton.

âš¡ Fun fact: I love Chipotle!
