### Hi there 👋
I am a Master's student in Biomedical Engineering at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/), interested in advancing surgical robotics design to revolutionize interventional care using mixed reality and human-in-the-loop interfaces. I am a member of the [Advanced Robotics and Computationally Augmented Environments](https://arcade.cs.jhu.edu/) ([ARCADE](https://arcade.cs.jhu.edu/)) research group, led by [Mathias Unberath](https://mathiasunberath.github.io). 

In 2022, I earned a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering with Honors from [University of California, Davis](https://bme.ucdavis.edu/). In my free time, you can find me hiking and playing badminton.

⚡ Fun fact: I love Chipotle!
